## Welcome to Ariana Williams page.

I am finishing my bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I am displaying some of the work that I have completed throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University.

## Code Review
I have created an initial code review to review the original state of my artifacts. If you are interested in my code review you can find it here. [code review]

## Five Destiantions
In this project I created a runable jar file for a made up travel agency. The user has the ability to look through photos destinations, get more information about the destinations, and fill out an inquiry sheet to get more information.
[Five Destinations jar file](https://github.com/ariana-d-williams1/ariana-d-williams1.github.io/blob/main/fiveDestinationsRun.jar).

## Hash Tables
In this project I imported data so that I could preform a hash function. In my original hash function the search function time ranged from 0.0013 seconds to 0.006 seconds. After my enhancements the search function time range is 0.006 seconds to 0.005 seconds. If you would like to view this program you can find it here [Hash Table] (https://github.com/ariana-d-williams1/ariana-d-williams1.github.io/tree/ariana-d-williams1-hashtable).

## Database

In this project I restructured a database document that I created. More importantly, I used JMP a data mining tool to make data analysis. JMP is an important tool that many companies can use to help make pertinent decisions for the company.
