## Welcome to Ariana Williams page.

I am finishing my bachelor’s degree in computer science. I am displaying some of the work that I have completed throughout my time at Southern New Hampshire University.

# Self Assessment 

I am Ariana Williams; I am graduating from Southern New Hampshire University with my Bachelor of Science in computer science. Through out my time at SNHU I have grown not only as a computer programmer but also as a person. Mastering my critical thinking skills, time management, and advancing my understanding of computer programming. Moving forward I will obtain my master’s degree in software engineering. 
Working to create this ePortfolio I have highlighted my strengths in design, mathematics in data structures, as well as analyzing data. Reviewing my own work created some challenges that I had to overcome. One of the first challenges that I faced was working with critical analysis and an open mind. While I was working to improve the work that I completed earlier in my computer science career I realized how much I have grown. My ability to identify a problem, asses the situation, and create several solutions to address the problem is one of my many strengths. For example, as I worked through my hash table artifact, I had to decide based on my data set which hash function would minimize the range of speeds at which the data was returned. There were several options that I considered but after assessing the size of the data set, I was given I decided to do a double hash function. Another, strength that I developed was my technical coding skills and communication skills. For example, my ability to look at code and interpret the outcome has advanced. 

Through out my time at SNHU, I have worked in collaboration with a team to produce quality programs. In one of my courses working as a team using the agile method, we created a database for an animal shelter. In that project we focused on scrum meetings, sprints, and testing. This allowed me the opportunity to not only review my peers code but also understand and implement their reviews on my code. I practiced communicating to stakeholders in my data analysis course. In that course I worked with a data mining tool to analysis a company’s data, and I was able to determine why the company was losing revenue. After I created and tested my hypothesis for why the company was losing revenue, I imported graphs and charts into a report for the company’s stakeholders to review. I developed and tested several hash functions in my data structure and algorithms course. I was able to understand how specific hash functions affect the speed of a program and how it will affect a company in different situations. In addition to working with the agile method to create the animal shelter database I also worked on security for the database and company’s data. Lastly, in my database course I created a database using sql and performed sql searches to analyze the data that was imported. 

To best show case all the above skills I chose three artifacts that focused specifically on software design, data structures and algorithms, as well as databases. The artifact that I chose to show my skills in software design is a program that was a simple list view of photos. I enhanced the artifact by adding additional functions, additional pages, and restructured the design of the gui screen. The second artifact that I chose to show my skills in data structures and algorithms uses hash tables. Originally, the hash function produced a large speed range. I enhanced the algorithm by choosing a more suitable hash function for the data that reduced the speed range. Finally, the artifact that I chose to showcase my skills in databases is a document that included sql searches and the output of the searches. I enhanced the document by restructuring the layout of the document to also showcase my communication skills, as well as implementing some data mining tables to further the assist with data analysis that the company could use to solve complex problems. 

## Code Review

I have created an initial code review to review the original state of my artifacts. If you are interested in my code review you can find it here. [code review]

## Five Destiantions

In this project I created a runable jar file for a made up travel agency. The user has the ability to look through photos destinations, get more information about the destinations, and fill out an inquiry sheet to get more information.
[Five Destinations jar file](https://github.com/ariana-d-williams1/ariana-d-williams1.github.io/blob/main/fiveDestinationsRun.jar).

## Hash Tables

In this project I imported data so that I could preform a hash function. In my original hash function the search function time ranged from 0.0013 seconds to 0.006 seconds. After my enhancements the search function time range is 0.006 seconds to 0.005 seconds. If you would like to view this program you can find it here

## Database

In this project I restructured a database document that I created. More importantly, I used JMP a data mining tool to make data analysis. JMP is an important tool that many companies can use to help them make pertinent decisions for the company.
